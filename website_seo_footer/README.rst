======================
Website SEO Footer
======================

This module remove Heading tags and obfuscate default links from search engines (for Page Rank Sculpture).

Headings in footer break the page readibility for search engines and thus, should be avoid.

Footer links are not the biggest SEO problem, but they have bad effect on page rank, as you should allways control what pages got page rank from important pages. Purpose of obfuscated links is to not send "Page Rank juice" to each page linked in footer. Links are not obfuscated to visitors, only to search engines (as long as they ignore Javascript form). TROUVER UN LIEN EXPLICATIF 

WARNING : The module will re-enable the default Odoo automatic footer with Headings removed and obfuscated links. The module will replace your customized footer, but will not rewrite it by improving it. Once installed, you will have to customize and recreate texts and links manualy.

For complete SEO footer one should install also SEO Footer More (website_seo_footer_more).
