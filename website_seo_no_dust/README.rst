===================
Website SEOÂ no DUST
===================

Odoo add queries in URLs (like page number, price sorting, etc.), creating several 
URLs for the same product page. This is to avoid in SEO because the same content 
can be accessed by different URLs. As a result, search engines index quickly grows 
uselessly and your page rank goes down. This bad practice is called DUST : 
Duplicate URL Same Text. 

This module removes queries in products URLs, keeping only categories if needed.
