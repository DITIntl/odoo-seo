Website SEO no DUST
===================

This module removes queries in products URLs, keeping only categories if
needed.

Odoo add queries in URLs (like page number, price sorting, etc.),
creating several URLs for the same product page. This is to avoid in SEO
because the same content can be accessed by different URLs. As a result,
search engines index quickly grows uselessly and your page rank goes
down. This bad practice is called DUST : Duplicate URL Same Text.

You should also disable sorting in the shop because it use URLs, which
creates a lot of duplicate content :

1. in website frontend, go to Customize menu ;
2. disable “Show Sort by”.

Instead of disabling the sort, experienced webmasters may prefer to set
URL parameters in search engines console. Beware that you should do that
for every search engine (whereever possible).

It is highly recommended to install also the OCA module `Website
Canonical URL`_. It will add the canonical URL in the header of each
page as `recommended by Google`_.
