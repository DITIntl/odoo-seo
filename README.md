## Small modules to fix SEO problems

Odoo modules to enhance SEO according to Olivier Andrieu books (see www.abondance.com).
Following an audit by Olivier andrieu om my Odoo website, I've started to create small modules to fix SEOÂ problems with Odoo 10. 
All of this is GPL and should be easily ported to other Odoo versions.


SEO Footer modules remove headings in footer because they confused search engines on page purpose, 
they also obfuscate links in footer to search engines because those links are bad for distributed page rank. 
Search engines can still found those links from Sitemap, which is automaticaly provided by Odoo.
