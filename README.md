## Small modules to fix SEO problems

Odoo modules to enhance SEO according to Olivier Andrieu books (see www.abondance.com) 
Following an audit by Olivier andrieu, I've started to create small modules to fix SEOÂ problems with Odoo 10. 
All of this is GPL and should be easily ported to other Odoo versions.
