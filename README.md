# odoo-seo
Odoo modules to enhance SEO according to Olivier Andrieu books (see www.abondance.com) 
Following an audit by Olivier andrieu, I've started to create small modules to fix SEOÂ problems with Odoo 10. 
All of this is GPL and should be easily ported to other Odoo versions.

* website_extend_web_editor     Curently does nothing yet
* website_seo_breadcrumb        Add structured datas and H6 tags in breadcrumb
* website_seo_footer            Remove headings and obfuscate links in footer, 
* website_seo_footer_payment    Remode headings
* website_seo_obfuscate_link    Provide CSS and add obfuscate tool in web-editor
* website_seo_no_dust           Remove URLs parameters
