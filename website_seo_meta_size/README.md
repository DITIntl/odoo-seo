# Website SEO Header

Increase length of meta title and meta description fields.

Odoo limit meta Title to 70 characters, but Google doesn't have such limit. The 2 real limits are 

1. for the home page, the site name must be in the first 600 pixels (nearly 70 characters), for the other pages the site name must end each meta Title ; 
2. on the search results page, Google will display only 70 characters (Bing 40). 

Title length is not otherwise limited. This module allows 110 characters in meta Title (maxTitleSize).

Since november 2017 Google increase the meta description length to nearly 300 characters. This module allows 300 characters in meta Description (maxDescriptionSize).

## TODO

- words count : between 10 to 12 words
- print product category
- configurable length
- add tips
- truncate rendering as Google (title is 70), URL is from 78 (no https) to 90 (https)
- render url without http if there is no SSL
