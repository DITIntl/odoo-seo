# Website SEO Footer Payments

Remove Heading tag (H4) from payments method list in footer and obfuscate additional links.
 
Purpose of obfuscated links is to not send "Page Rank juice" to each page linked in footer. Links are not obfuscated to visitors, only to search engines (as long as they ignore Javascript form).
