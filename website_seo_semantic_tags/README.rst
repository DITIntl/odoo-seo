SEO Semantic Tags Plugin
========================

This is an extension for the web editor. It removes most of the font bar
and replace it by some `Inline text elements`_ :

-  ``<strong>`` defines important text, rendered as **bold**
-  ``<em>`` defines emphasized text, rendered as *italic*
-  ``<mark>`` defines marked text and highlight it

-  ``<q>`` defines a short quotation
-  ``<cite>`` defines the title of a book, a song, a movie, etc.
-  ``<abbr>`` defines an abbreviation or an acronym
-  ``<dfn>`` is the defining instance of a term

-  ``<del>`` defines text that has been deleted from a document
-  ``<ins>`` defines text that has been inserted into a document

Limitations
-----------

-  This module doesn’t use summernote’s built in parser, but it can
   handle some basic cross-node insertions.
-  The elements won’t toggle on and off, however they will clear with
   the ``Remove Font Style`` button
