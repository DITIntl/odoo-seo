# Website SEO Blog

## Breadcrumb

Odoo build breadcrumbs as a Bootstrap component. It miss structured datas.

With this module elements are structured by schema.org microdatas as recommended by Google. This will improve search result pages (SERP).

Additionaly, the module build breadcrumb with Heading tag (<h6>) to give more importance to its keywords.

## Blog home page

Subtitle switch from H3 to H2 which is better for Google. Blog description gain microdatas and is surround by h5.

## Footer

Obfuscate blog links in footer ("News"). Depends on website_blog.
 
Purpose of obfuscated links is to not send "Page Rank juice" to each page linked in footer. Links are not obfuscated to visitors, only to search engines (as long as they ignore Javascript form).
